# React Boilerplate

I've decided to make a standard boilerplate, with my favourite stack, to start easy React app development.

It has always been a time-consuming process of configuration, creation and wrapping up stuff just to start a real work. With my boilerplate you don't need to get through it every single time.

### How to
1. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/dkocjan/react-boilerplate.git AnotherReactProject`
2. Go into it `cd AnotherReactProject`
3. Install dependencies `yarn install`
4. Start working!

##### You can choose between different scripts
*  `yarn dev` starts webpack-dev-server
*  `yarn build` builds `bundle.js`  
*  `yarn format` formats files with prettier, ignoring `/public` and `/node_modules`
*  `yarn lint` lints with eslint, ignoring unnecessary files aswell

Look up `package.json` for more information
